# webview_package implementation


* ### [webview_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter)

#### This Flutter project to implement new packages by utilizing the 'webview' package.

#### The WebView widget allows you to show the website content right inside your app. It's useful in a case where you don't want your users to leave your app to view the web page


##### The app features a login screen with four buttons: 

* Google
* YouTube
* Facebook
* Instagram

 ##### Each button, when clicked, seamlessly takes the user to the official URL of the corresponding website. By leveraging the 'webview' package, this app provides a convenient and user-friendly way to access these popular platforms directly from a mobile application. Through this project, I showcased my skills in Flutter development, package integration, and creating intuitive user interfaces

##### Feel free to explore and test the functionality of this project by pulling the code from the repository. By doing so, you can directly experience the implementation of the 'webview' package, And don't hesitate to play around with the app once you have it!
