# geolocator package

The Flutter Geolocator package is a plugin that provides geolocation capabilities to Flutter applications. It allows you to retrieve the current device location, monitor location updates, and obtain various information related to the device's location.


# geocoding package


Flutter Geocoding package is a plugin that provides geocoding and reverse geocoding capabilities to Flutter applications. Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (such as street names) into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), while reverse geocoding involves converting geographic coordinates into human-readable addresses.

The Flutter Geocoding package allows you to perform these operations using various geocoding providers, such as Google Maps, MapQuest, and OpenCage. By integrating this package into your Flutter app, you can easily retrieve location information and work with geospatial data.
